## 1. Why is there no need for a border exchange when using Pthreads?

Therefore it is unnecessary to include communicating the border points between threads.

## 2. What is the difference between OpenMP and MPI?

## 3. Comment on the difference between Pthreads and the two OpenMP implementations.

## 4. How would you parallelise a recursion problem with OpenMP?
